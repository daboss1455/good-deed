<h3 style="color:red;">When you do a good deed for someone, you make their day a little better.
  Research shows that doing something nice for others can make your day a little better too.</h3>

<p style="color:red;">Studies show that one good deed leads to another. If you perform a generous or kind act, you are
  likely to be happier.
  The happier you feel, the more likely you are to do another kind act.</p>

<p style="color:red;">Good deeds are done on purpose. That’s different from not doing something you might normally do,
  like not screaming at another driver who cuts you off. That doesn’t count as a good deed. Some good deeds take
  planning.
  Planning helps you pay attention and be mindful of the good deed you’re doing. It also helps you be mindful of the
  other person’s needs.
  You might help friends or family members by running errands or helping with child care. Make some cookies for a person
  who did you a favor.
  Clean the house or cook dinner for an older friend or relative.
  Good deeds like these take some planning and help you understand what makes the other person happy.</p>

<p style="color:red;">Doing a good deed helps you focus your thoughts outward toward others. It helps you take a step
  outside your own world for a little while.
  Performing good deeds can have positive effects on your health, like reducing stress.</p>

<p style="color:red;">You also can do good deeds for total strangers to make their lives a little better.
  Or giving up some of your free time to volunteer, whether it’s serving at a soup kitchen,
  cleaning up litter, or taking elderly people to the grocery store. </p>
